Because this program was written in Python, the invocations are slightly
altered compared to those who chose to write their projects in another language.

Here are the correct ways to invoke the program:
  1. "python P0.py"
  2. "python P0.py < file.cs4280" ("file" can be any name)
  3. "python P0.py file" ("file" can be any name)
